Summary of changes made to ensure consistent datasets across repetitions and beta values.

PROBLEM:
- Previously, each repetition created a new dataset with a different random seed (seed=rep)
- This caused different class distributions for each repetition and beta value
- Made it impossible to fairly compare results across different beta values
- Results were inconsistent due to varying datasets rather than model differences

SOLUTION:
Modified the code to create the dataset once with a fixed seed and reuse it across all experiments.

CHANGES MADE:

1. Modified training.py:
   - Updated run_beta_experiments() to accept optional train_loader and test_loader parameters
   - Added logic to use provided dataloaders when available, fall back to old behavior otherwise
   - This maintains backward compatibility while enabling the new consistent dataset approach

2. Modified main.py:
   - Added dataloader creation code that runs once before experiments start
   - Uses fixed random seed (42) for consistent dataset across all runs
   - Passes the created dataloaders to run_beta_experiments()
   - Updated n_train calculation to use len(train_loader.dataset) instead of len(train_dataset)

3. Added imports:
   - Added get_synth_dataloaders_random_labels to the imports in main.py

BENEFITS:
- All repetitions now use the exact same dataset
- All beta values are tested on identical data
- Class distributions are consistent across all experiments
- Only model initialization varies between repetitions (as intended)
- Fair comparison between different beta values
- Eliminates dataset variation as a confounding factor

VERIFICATION:
- Created test scripts to verify the changes work correctly
- Tested that dataset creation produces consistent results
- Verified that the same class distribution is used across all experiments
