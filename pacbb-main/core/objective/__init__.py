"""
## Overview
Hosts a variety of PAC-Bayes training objectives that combine empirical
loss and KL divergence in different ways.

## Contents
- **AbstractObjective**: A base interface
- **BBBObjective, FClassicObjective, FQuadObjective, McAllesterObjective, TolstikhinObjective**

By choosing an appropriate objective, you can guide training to minimize
a PAC-Bayes bound on the modelâ€™s risk.
